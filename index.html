<h1>LITTLE HANDS,BIG CURIOSITY</h1>
<P>When I was just eleven years old, my world changed forever the day my parents brought home a sleek, 
    brand-new PlayStation 4. It sat quietly in the living room, its smooth black surface gleaming under 
    the warm glow of the lamps, like a treasure waiting to be discovered. The soft hum it made when 
    powered on filled the room with excitement and promise. I was instantly captivated—not just
     by the games it could play or the colorful adventures it offered, but by the mysterious machine
      itself. It was unlike anything I had seen before, a tiny universe of technology humming quietly,
       inviting me to explore its secrets.</P>
   <P>That night, after the house had fallen into deep silence and everyone else was sound asleep, 
    I found myself wide awake, unable to resist the irresistible urge to sneak out of bed and get a closer
     look. Quietly, I tiptoed to the living room where the PS4 sat, its gentle blue light shining softly
      in the dark. I rummaged through the toolbox and found a small screwdriver—the perfect tool for
       my midnight mission. With cautious hands and pounding heart, I carefully began taking the console 
       apart, piece by piece. Each circuit board, chip, and tangled wire inside fascinated me like
        fragments of a secret puzzle waiting to be solved. The soft glow from the console’s inner 
        components cast dancing shadows around the room as I studied every tiny part, my eyes wide
         with wonder and curiosity..</P>   
         <P>Of course, I was far too young and inexperienced to put it back together correctly, 
            and the console remained open and silent by the time morning light crept through the windows. 
            But that didn’t matter. That night ignited a spark deep inside me—a relentless curiosity 
            and a passion for understanding how things work. It was more than just dismantling a machine;
             it was the beginning of a lifelong journey fueled by wonder, discovery, and the joy 
             of figuring things out. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to explore, create, and never
              stop learning.</P>
